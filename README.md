## Development model

Hydrogen is a closed-source project and follows the development model "Move Fast and Break Things". This means that the project is constantly changing and nothing is guaranteed to be stable, but when something reaches a stable state, it will be released as a separate project under the Hydrogen Framework. This way, you can use the same tools and libraries that power Hydrogen in your own projects without having to worry about the constant changes in Hydrogen.

## Projects

- [Hydrogen I18n](https://github.com/nashiradeer/hydrogen-framework/blob/main/hydrogen-i18n): Translation utilities for server-side applications that need to deal with different languages at the same time.
- [Hydrolink](https://github.com/nashiradeer/hydrogen-framework/blob/main/hydrolink): An implementation of a Lavalink client made with tokio independent of the Discord library, used in production by Hydrogen.
